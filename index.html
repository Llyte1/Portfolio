                I am committed to helping my students develop a strong foundation in the fundamentals of the language.
                         I work closely with my grade 5 and 9 students to ensure that they have a solid understanding of
                        grammatical concepts such as parts of speech, sentence structure, and punctuation.
                    I use a variety of teaching methods and resources, including interactive activities, group discussions,
                    and real-world examples, to engage my students and make the learning process enjoyable.
                     I also provide regular feedback and assessments to help my students track their progress
                    and identify areas for improvement. My ultimate goal is to help my students become confident
